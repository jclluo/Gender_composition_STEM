Job Market Paper  We introduce a distinction between outward thinking (inferential heuristics based on generalized relationships) vs. inward thinking (inferential heuristics based on the specifics of one’s situation) and show that how consumers infer impact from prevalence information depends on framing cues. While general framing and word-based cues prompt outward thinking, with consumers drawing inferences from broad patterns encountered in the outside world (e.g., tradeoffs between attributes), specific framing and numeric cues prompt inward thinking, a focus on local inferences from the focal instance (e.g., conflation of attributes). As a result, higher level of impact (e.g., high severity of a consumer problem) is more likely to be associated with lower prevalence (e.g., a rare occurrence) when prevalence information is framed generally and in words, and is more likely to be associated with higher prevalence (e.g., a common occurrence) when prevalence information is framed in specific terms and numerically. This effect has consequences for decision-making, reversing consumers’ decisions to repair (vs. to replace) a product with a problem and impacting consumers’ real donation decisions.   Yu, Jiaqi, and Oleg Urminsky, “A Mere Presence Effect of Asymmetric Information:  Consumers Rely on Attribute Presence but Ignore Magnitude When Making Purchasing Decisions,” Under review at Journal of Marketing  Discretionary disclosures of quantitative product attributes often vary across products. For example, one brand of milk may feature their protein content on the package label, while the other does not. How would such asymmetric claims affect consumer choices? We predict that consumers will often be sensitive to the mere presence of a quantified claim, preferring a product that presents attribute quantity regardless of the substance communicated (e.g., high vs. low value of the attribute). Across eight pre-registered studies, we find a robust mere-presence effect, in which consumers judge products more favorably when a quantitative quality-relevant attribute is presented, even when the quantitative information is not evaluable and represents a low level of quality. Consumers fail to recognize the lack of evaluability and edit out the claim, instead seemingly relying on an “if it’s disclosed, it must  5 be good” heuristic. Our findings demonstrate that, under certain circumstances, information disclosure may impede, rather than facilitate, consumers’ judgments of product quality.  Yu, Jiaqi, and Shereen J. Chaudhry (2024), “‘Thanks, but no thanks’: Gratitude Expression Paradoxically Signals Distance,” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 126(1), 58–78.  Many studies have found that feelings and expressions of gratitude bring profound benefits to people and relationships. We complicate this view of gratitude. We examine two variables known to impact people’s expectations for relationships: Culture (collectivist vs. individualist) and relational distance (close vs. distant), and we find evidence that expressing gratitude conveys that relationship expectations have been exceeded, such that people view it as less desirable to give and receive gratitude for actions that are expected duties of a relationship. In both observational data and real behavior in an experiment, we found that people in a collectivist culture (China) are less likely than those in an individualist culture (America) to express gratitude to close others. These differences in expressing gratitude reflect differences in underlying feelings of gratitude, as well as differences in expectations of how the target would react to being thanked. Overall, our findings suggest that expressing gratitude may not always be good for close relationships.  Chen, Stephanie, Oleg Urminsky, and Jiaqi Yu (2023), “We Do What We Are: Representation of the Self-Concept and Identity-Based Choice,” Journal of Consumer Research, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucad066.  The current research proposes a novel approach to identity-based choice that focuses on consumers’ representations of the self-concept, as captured by the perceived cause–effect relationships among features of an individual consumer’s self-concept. More specifically, the studies reported here test the proposal that the causal centrality of an identity—the number of other features of a consumer’s self-concept that the consumer believes influenced or were influenced by the identity—underlies identity importance and is a determinant of identity-based consumer behaviors. Across seven studies, using both measured and manipulated causal centrality, the current research provides evidence for the role of causal centrality in identity-based choice. Among consumers who share an identity (belong to the same social category), those who believe that the identity is more causally central perceive the identity as more important and are more likely to engage in behaviors consistent with the norms of the social category.  Yu, Jiaqi, Christopher K. Hsee, and Xilin Li, “Sacrifice and Satisfaction: Field Evidence Shows Highlighting Doctors’ Sacrifice Increases Patients’ Satisfaction.”   Many patients are dissatisfied with their doctors. How can medical institutions enhance patients’ satisfaction with their doctors in situations that are suboptimal for the patient but beyond the doctor’s control? Many medical institutions try to give patients good impressions of their doctors by highlighting the doctors’ expertise. We propose an alternative method— 6 highlighting doctors’ self-sacrifice. Study 1 asked medical professionals to predict whether highlighting expertise or highlighting self-sacrifice would be the more effective, and most chose to highlight expertise, which suggests that our proposition is non-obvious. Study 2 tested and supported our proposition in an ecologically-valid scenario with participants who had recent patient experience. Study 3 replicated the finding in a field experiment at a large hospital. We conclude that highlighting self-sacrifice is an overlooked but cost-effective way to improve the doctor-patient relationship and offer recommendations for the implementation of this strategy.
